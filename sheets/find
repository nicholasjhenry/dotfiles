# Example

$ find /usr -name php $ find ./ -name 'php*'

# Find and executing commands based on it's results

This code removes all log files 15 days or older:

    find . -name '*.log' -mtime +15 -exec rm "{}" \;

* Remove the sign to get exactly 15 days
* "{}" executes the result
* All special shell characters needs to be escaped including the required semicolon at the end
