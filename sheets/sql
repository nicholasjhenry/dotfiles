Only Matched Rows:

    JOIN == INNER JOIN

Includes Unmatched Rows:

    FULL OUTER JOIN (include both columns)
    LEFT OUTER JOIN == LEFT JOIN (i.e. left of the JOIN Keyword)
    RIGHT OUTER JOIN == RIGHT JOIN (i.e. right of the JOIN keyword)

More Information See Tip 302-304 in SQL Tips & Techniques Book

Note: In MySQL you can drop the OUTER keyword, e.g. LEFT JOIN
