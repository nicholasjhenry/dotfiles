To replace an existing SSL certificate, just copy it into the .crt file (backup the old first)

    /etc/httpd/conf/ssl.crt/[application/host].crt

Create a new CSR based on an existing key

    sudo openssl req -new -key ssl.key/your_cert.key -out server.csr

Installing SSL Certificate

Get the following message?

  SSLCertificateFile: file '/etc/httpd/conf/ssl.crt/your_certificate.crt' does not exist or is empty

Check the read permissions on the file:

  sudo chmod +r your_certificate.crt
